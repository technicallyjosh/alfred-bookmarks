# Alfred Brave Browser Bookmarks

A simple and fast workflow for searching and launching Brave Browser bookmarks.

## Why this workflow?

- No python dependency
- It's faster than the others
- Supports all profiles

***Right now this is set up to look specifically for the profiles in the logged
in user's directory. If you installed Brave for all users, this may not work
properly.***

## Usage

### Basic

Type `bb <term>` when pulling up Alfred.

### Commands

- Clear cache<br>
  Type `bb` and select `Clear cache`

This is my first Alfred workflow so any suggestions or PRs are welcome!
