# Alfred Browser Bookmarks

A simple and fast workflow for searching and launching browser bookmarks.

***Formerly Alfred Brave Bookmarks. I wanted to expand to other browsers as I 
tend to hop around on them :).***

## Browsers supported

- Brave
- Microsoft Edge

## Why this workflow?

- No python dependency
- It's faster than the others
- Supports all profiles for the selected browser

***Right now this is set up to look specifically for the profiles in the 
logged-in user's directory. If you installed a browser for all users, this may 
not work properly.***

## Usage

### Setup

- Type `bm`
- Select "Configure"
- Select your browser

### Basic

Type `bm <term>` when pulling up Alfred.

### Configure

`bm` -> Configure

- Set Brave Browser
- Set Microsoft Edge Browser
- Clear Cache
- Clear Data
